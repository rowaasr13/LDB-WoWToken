LDB: WoW Token, v1

* http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/ldb-wow-token

This addon monitors and displays changes of WoW Token price. It will display current price and history for last ten known changes, showing price itself, time and difference with previous price. It is an LDB module: you will need an LDB display addon to use it - like Titan Panel, Bazooka, Bagnon (yes, it does have LDB display on bag frames) or any other.
